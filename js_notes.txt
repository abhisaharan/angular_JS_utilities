# When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.
 - JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results

# avaScript Numbers
  JavaScript has only one type of numbers.
  Numbers can be written with, or without decimals
  Ex: 1.00 or 1

# JavaScript Arrays
  JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
  var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

# JavaScript Objects
  JavaScript objects are written with curly braces.
  Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
  var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
----------------------
# The typeof Operator
  You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.
----------------------

# Null
  In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
  Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
  You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.
