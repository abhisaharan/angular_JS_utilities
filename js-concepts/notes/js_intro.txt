# To run javascript code:
    - Browser
    - press Ctrl + Shift + I or F12 once you open your browser.
    - in the console tab you can type any valid JavaScript statement and it will run it in the context of the web page.

# The <script> Tag
    In HTML, JavaScript code must be inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

# JavaScript in <head> or <body>
    You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

# Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

# External JavaScript
    Scripts can also be placed in external files:
    External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.
    JavaScript files have the file extension .js.
    To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
    <script src="myScript.js">
    ...
    </script>
    note**: External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.

# External JavaScript Advantages
    Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:
    - It separates HTML and code
    - It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
    - Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
    External scripts can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.
    Ex: <script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript1.js"></script>

# JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

  Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
  Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
  Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
  Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
  Note**: The document.write() method should only be used for testing. Using document.write() after an HTML document is fully loaded, will delete all existing HTML
