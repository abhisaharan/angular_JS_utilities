# Important methods
    - toString() returns a number as a string. Ex: (123).toString();
    - toExponential() returns a string, with a number rounded and written using exponential notation.

# Converting Variables to Numbers
  There are 3 JavaScript methods that can be used to convert variables to numbers:
    Number()	Returns a number, converted from its argument. **Number() can also convert a date to a number. Ex: Number(new Date("2017-09-30"));    // returns 1506729600000
    parseFloat()	Parses its argument and returns a floating point number
    parseInt()	Parses its argument and returns an integer. Only the first number is returned
