# JavaScript Date Objects //https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_dates.asp
    - Date objects are created with the new Date() constructor.
    - new Date(): creates a new date object with the current date and time.
    "new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)"
    - JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11.
    - You cannot omit month. If you supply only one parameter it will be treated as milliseconds.
    - new Date(dateString) creates a new date object from a date string. var d = new Date("October 13, 2014 11:13:00");
    - JavaScript Stores Dates as Milliseconds
    - The toUTCString() method converts a date to a UTC string (a date display standard).
    - The toDateString() method converts a date to a more readable format.
    - If you have a valid date string, you can use the Date.parse() method to convert it to milliseconds.
