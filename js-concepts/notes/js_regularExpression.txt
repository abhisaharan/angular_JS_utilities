# Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

  Syntax: /pattern/modifiers;
  Ex: var patt = /w3schools/i;
  /w3schools/i  is a regular expression. w3schools  is a pattern (to be used in a search). i  is a modifier (modifies the search to be case-insensitive).

# In JavaScript, regular expressions are often used with the two string methods: search() and replace().
    - Using String replace() With a String
    - string.search(): The search() method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match:
    - pattern.test(): It searches a string for a pattern, and returns true or false, depending on the result.
    - pattern.exec(): It searches a string for a specified pattern, and returns the found text.
